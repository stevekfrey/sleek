```

## Development Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start frontend development server only
- `npm run dev:proxy` - Start Linear API proxy server only
- `npm run dev:all` - Start both frontend and proxy servers
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build

## Customization

### Styling
The dashboard uses Tailwind CSS for styling. You can customize:
- Colors in `tailwind.config.js`
- Component styles in `src/index.css`
- Individual component styling

### Data Mapping
Linear data is automatically mapped to the dashboard format:
- Linear issues â†’ Tasks
- Linear states â†’ Task status
- Linear priorities â†’ Task priorities
- Linear assignees â†’ Team members

### Adding Features
The modular component structure makes it easy to add new features:
- New chart types
- Additional filters
- Custom visualizations
- Export functionality

## API Reference

### Linear API Integration
The dashboard uses Linear's GraphQL API to fetch:
- Teams and team members
- Issues with full details
- Issue states and priorities
- Assignee information

### Proxy Server
The proxy server handles CORS issues by:
- Forwarding requests to Linear API
- Adding proper CORS headers
- Maintaining authentication headers

### Data Conversion
Linear data is converted to the dashboard format:
```typescript
// Linear Issue â†’ Dashboard Task
{
  id: issue.id,
  title: issue.title,
  status: convertLinearState(issue.state.name),
  priority: convertLinearPriority(issue.priority),
  assigneeId: issue.assignee?.id,
  // ... other mappings
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **CORS Errors**
   - Ensure the proxy server is running (`npm run dev:all`)
   - Check that both servers are running on correct ports
   - Verify proxy server is accessible at http://localhost:3001

2. **API Key Issues**
   - Ensure your Linear API key is correct
   - Check that the key has proper permissions
   - Verify the key hasn't expired

3. **No Data Loading**
   - Check your internet connection
   - Verify Linear API is accessible
   - Ensure your team has issues assigned
   - Try demo mode to test the dashboard

4. **Build Errors**
   - Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed
   - Check Node.js version (requires 16+)
   - Clear npm cache if needed

### Getting Help
- Try demo mode first to verify the dashboard works
- Check the browser console for error messages
- Verify your Linear API key permissions
- Ensure your team has data to import
